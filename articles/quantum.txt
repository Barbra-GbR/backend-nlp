Quantum computing is computing using quantummechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement.1 A quantum computer is a device that performs quantum computing. They are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits bits, each of which is always in one of two definite states 0 or 1, quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. The field of quantum computing was initiated by the work of Paul Benioff de2 and Yuri Manin in 1980,3 Richard Feynman in 1982,4 and David Deutsch in 1985.5 A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum spacetime in 1968.6
As of 2018, the development of actual quantum computers is still in its infancy, but experiments have been carried out in which quantum computational operations were executed on a very small number of quantum bits.7 Both practical and theoretical research continues, and many national governments and military agencies are funding quantum computing research in additional effort to develop quantum computers for civilian, business, trade, environmental and national security purposes, such as cryptanalysis.8 A small 20qubit quantum computer exists and is available for experiments via the IBM quantum experience project. DWave Systems has been developing their own version of a quantum computer which uses annealing.9
Largescale quantum computers would theoretically be able to solve certain problems much more quickly than any classical computers that use even the best currently known algorithms, like integer factorization using Shors algorithm which is a quantum algorithm and the simulation of quantum manybody systems. There exist quantum algorithms, such as Simons algorithm, that run faster than any possible probabilistic classical algorithm.10 A classical computer could in principle with exponential resources simulate a quantum algorithm, as quantum computation does not violate the ChurchTuring thesis.11202 On the other hand, quantum computers may be able to efficiently solve problems which are not practically feasible on classical computers.
